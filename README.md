# Precision Marketing Intelligence Platform

**Our solution is Precision Marketing Intelligence: A Data-Driven Dashboard for Growth — an AI + BI platform that helps companies optimize marketing campaigns with predictive insights and interactive dashboards.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **Marketing teams lack a unified view of customers**
- **Campaigns are often reactive, not predictive**
- **Personalization at scale is too resource-heavy**
- **Hard to know which channels drive conversions**

These lead to wasted ad spend, low ROI, and missed growth opportunities.

## 🚀 Our Solution

We're building a smart marketing intelligence platform that unifies customer data, predicts campaign success, and provides real-time insights through dashboards and alerts.

### Core Features
- **Interactive Dashboard** (Power BI + Web Integration)
- **AI/ML Predictions** (conversion likelihood, churn risk)
- **Collaboration & Reporting** (share dashboards, generate reports)
- **Real-Time Alerts & Notifications** (proactive triggers like CTR drops, rising costs)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Users → React Web App → Backend API (ML model) + Embedded Power BI Dashboard → Predictions + Reports
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **ML Integration**: Python ML pipeline
- **Dashboard**: Power BI Embedded
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections
